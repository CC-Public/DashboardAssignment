# Dashboard

## Overview

To successfully pass this assignment you need to develop a single-page **javascript** application which would represent user dashboard with a number of customizable widgets persisting their state and settings across sessions. Application layout should adopt for different screens (tablets/phones) and run flawlessly on desktop (IE 9+, FF, Chrome, Safari) and most common mobile platforms (iOS/Adroid/WP). 

## Technical Requirements

You are to use the following frameworks and technologies:

 * [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org). Show as much features as you can from angular but do not overcomplicate;
 * [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). Use classes and strong typing as much as possible;
 * [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) + [Less CSS](http://lesscss.org/). Use responsive 12-column grid-system and write less instead of css;
 * [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/). Cover you application at least with *minimum-necessary* tests;

Plus anything that helps you. But please try to keep the stack as thin as possible, so don't use extra dependecies unless you *really* need them. Additional credit would be given for those who *will not use jQuery*.

The quality of the code **matters** so please try not only to make it work but also make it readable and maintainable. We would also give much attention to you application's structure and code organization.

All the development has to be done in [GitHub](http://github.com/) or any other public source-code hosting service.

You can work on this assignment as long as you wish but the _strict requitrement_ would be **frequent commits**. Once finished, please send to [it@cc.com.mt](mailto:it@cc.com.mt) link to your repository and link to the published version.
